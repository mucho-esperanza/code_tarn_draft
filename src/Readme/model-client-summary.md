# 3. ModelClient: Language Model Translation Interface

## Core Purpose
A sophisticated client for interacting with language models to facilitate code translation, with robust error handling and response processing.

## Key Features
1. **Flexible Model Configuration**
   - Configurable model selection
   - Adjustable temperature settings
   - Support for additional model parameters

2. **Advanced Translation Mechanism**
   - Uses Ollama for model interaction
   - Extracts code from markdown code blocks
   - Handles various response formats

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Validates model temperature
   - Manages import errors
   - Handles communication failures
   - Provides informative logging

## Translation Process
1. Prepare translation prompt
2. Send request to Ollama model
3. Process and validate model response
4. Extract translated code

## Safety and Validation Mechanisms
- Temperature range validation
- Empty response detection
- Code block extraction
- Timeout configuration
- Detailed error logging
